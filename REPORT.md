# Vibe Coding Project Overview

## General Impression

This was my first serious attempt at **vibe coding**.  
The result is, in my opinion, a solid project with a decent codebase.  

The code is clean, modular, and overall quite maintainable.  

I also genuinely enjoyed the experience — especially listening to music  
while the agent was editing files, installing dependencies,  
and handling various programming tasks.

## Downsides of Vibe Coding

- **Perceived Slowness**: It feels slower, especially with the compiler agent, which is notably sluggish.
- **Limited Internet Access**: I didn’t add `mcp-service`, which likely limited agent capabilities.
- **Output Quality Issues**:
  - Occasional code duplication
  - Poor structure in some places
  - Dependency management can be flaky
- **Poor Autonomous Decisions**: Agents struggle with making good choices without guidance.
- **High Communication Overhead**: Requires a detailed `planning.md` to ensure agents follow intended steps.
- **Expensive Alternatives**: Faster agents (e.g., Claude Code) are costly.

## Upsides of Vibe Coding

- **Reduced Hands-on Time**: You offload a lot of repetitive tasks.
- **Peaceful Flow**: Good time to relax or meditate while agents do the work.
- **Creative Delegation**: Agents can handle larger-scale tasks if guided properly.

## Key Learnings

- **GitHub Copilot for Students**: Free and surprisingly capable.
- **Rule Setting is Crucial**:
  - Enforce style guidelines (e.g., docstrings, typing)
  - Choose tooling (e.g., use Poetry, prefer pytest)
- **Use `planning.md`**: Essential for scoping and coordination.
- **Manual Steps Still Matter**: Avoid delegating sensitive or environment-level tasks (e.g., env vars, package installs).
- **Future Plans**: Try using `mcp-service` for enhanced agent capability.
